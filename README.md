# CardDealer

## Description

An old project I made that is a basic program that will create a deck of cards and deals a hand of 7 cards to 3 players.
The deck has 4 suits (red, yellow, blue, and green) each with 10 number cards (1 - 10).

## Execution

I ran this using the in app run command for VSCode with the "Test Runner for Java" extension in the "Extension Pack for Java" package in VSCode.
